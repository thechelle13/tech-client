**TechPower - Project README**

Introduction:

Welcome to TechPower, a platform designed to connect employers with tech talent efficiently. This README provides an overview of the project, its purpose, development process, and key features.


Purpose and Motivation:

TechPower aims to simplify the process of finding and hiring tech talent by addressing fundamental employment questions. The platform allows users to register, create and manage posts for tech jobs, view a list of all posts, edit and delete their own posts, and more.


How It Works:

TechPower operates as a web application with user authentication. Users can register, log in, create, edit, and delete posts. The system also includes features such as viewing all posts and logging out securely.


How It Was Developed:

The development process followed the outlined user stories and criteria. The project utilizes a Sqlite database with user-related data, including at least one many-to-many relationship. Wireframes were created to illustrate the layout of each view, and an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) was designed to visualize the database structure.


How to Install and Run the Apps Used in Development:

**To install and run the application, follow these steps:**

Clone the repository.

bash
Copy code
git clone <repository-url>
Install dependencies.

bash
Copy code
npm install
Run the application.

bash
Copy code
npm start
Access the application in your web browser at http://localhost:3000.


Difficulties and Challenges Faced During Process:

Throughout the development process, several challenges were encountered, including user authentication, database design, and form handling. These challenges were addressed and resolved to ensure a robust and user-friendly application.
